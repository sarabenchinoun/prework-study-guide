# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created to keep notes, definitions, and other information learned on the Coding Bootcamp. It is a documentation of my journey in learning HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It solves a problem, every student faces, which is the difficulty to keep up with the abundance of information while learning to code from scratch. Therefore the website serves as a reminder of the lessons you learned and want to remember in the future.

### Lessons Learned

- How to structure a website using HTML.
- How to style and organise a website using CSS.
- How to make the website interactive using JavaScript.
- How to to stage, commit, push and pull using Git to save our work to GitHub.
- How to merge into the base branch safely in Github.
